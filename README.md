# GlideGame

Alpha branch: here is what I want to get done for the first stage of testing!

- [ ] Working speed boosts
  - [ ] Particle indications
  - [ ] Make sure the speeds are correct; correspond to OG game
  - [ ] Figure out which ones are yellow boosts and orange boosts, and adjust correspondingly?
- [ ] Working alt boosts
  - [ ] Particle indications
- [ ] Checkpoints (make sure the beacons are powered) (make sure that the range is big enough!)
- [ ] At least the OG three maps working
- [ ] Instant death when touching the ground, NOT THE WALLS!!
- [ ] "3 lives" for touching the ceiling or walls
- [ ] Time attack gamemode
  - [ ] Time in actionbar
  - [ ] Speed...somewhere, if I can
  - [ ] Certain amount of time for others to finish after one player has
- [ ] Correctly implemented solo mode

- [ ] Extra credit if I can implement score attack! (idk we have the rings for that though)
